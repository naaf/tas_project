    (* type of abstract elements *)
    (* an element of type t abstracts a set of mathematical integers *)
    type t
          
    (* unrestricted set: [-oo,+oo] *)
    val top: t

    (* comparison *)
    (* [compare x y op] returns (x',y') where
       - x' abstracts the set of v  in x such that v op v' is true for some v' in y
       - y' abstracts the set of v' in y such that v op v' is true for some v  in x
       i.e., we filter the abstract values x and y knowing that the test is true

       a safe, but not precise implementation, would be:
       compare x y op = (x,y)
     *)
    val compare: t -> t -> compare_op -> (t * t)



    (* 
       the following, more advanced operations are useful to handle
       complex tests more precisely
     *)

        
    (* backards unary operation *)
    (* [bwd_unary x op r] returns x':
       - x' abstracts the set of v in x such as op v is in r
       i.e., we fiter the abstract values x knowing the result r of applying
       the operation on x

       it is safe, as first approximation, to implement it as the identity:
       let bwd_unary x _ _ = x
     *)
    val bwd_unary: t -> int_unary_op -> t -> t

  
     (* backward binary operation *)
     (* [bwd_binary x y op r] returns (x',y') where
       - x' abstracts the set of v  in x such that v op v' is in r for some v' in y
       - y' abstracts the set of v' in y such that v op v' is in r for some v  in x
       i.e., we filter the abstract values x and y knowing that, after
       applying the operation op, the result is in r

       it is safe, as first approximation, to implement it as the identity:
       let bwd_binay x y _ _ = (x,y)
      *)
    val bwd_binary: t -> t -> int_binary_op -> t -> (t * t)
